# Tachi-Server

Tachi-Server is the backend for Tachi.

## What's it do?

- Hosts an express backend server.
- Opens a public API on `/api`.
- Supports various IR frameworks under `/ir`
- Powers a ridiculously overengineered score import framework.


## Setup

Make sure you've ran the bootstrap script in `../_scripts`. You can then start the server with
`pnpm start` (in this directory) or `pnpm start-server` at the top level.
