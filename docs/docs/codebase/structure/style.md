# Style

For style, we use a custom tool called [Cadence](https://github.com/CadenceJS/Cadence).

This is effectively a huge ESLint config with everything I care about enabled.

It's worth noting that this is an *extremely strict* linter. You are **expected** to have "Format on Save" turned on, in order to use this linter properly.

!!! info
	You can run ESLint in the repo any time with `pnpm lint`.
