# GPT-Target Endpoints

These endpoints deal with [targets](../../api/terminology.md) for a Game + Playtype. These are things like searching goals or quests, or retrieving information about a specific ID.

For user-specific target endpoints, such as subscriptions, see [UGPT-Target Endpoints](./ugpt-targets.md).

*****

## Retrieve this game's recently achieved targets

`GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/recently-achieved`

!!! info
	This endpoint returns the 100 most recently achieved goal subscriptions, and 50 most recently achieved quest subscriptions.

	A target is not considered recently achieved if it was [instantly achieved](../../codebase/implementation-details/goals-quests.md#instant-indirect-achievements).

### Parameters

None.

### Response

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `goals` | Array&lt;GoalDocument&gt; | The goal documents that were recently achieved. |
| `quests` | Array&lt;QuestDocument&gt; | The quest documents that were recently achieved. |
| `goalSubs` | Array&lt;GoalSubDocument&gt; | User subscriptions to goals that were recently achieved. |
| `questSubs` | Array&lt;QuestSubDocument&gt; | User subscriptions to quests that were recently achieved. |

### Example

#### Request
```
GET /api/v1/games/iidx/SP/targets/recently-achieved
```

#### Response

```js
{
	goals: [{
		name: "HARD CLEAR 5.1.1 Another",
		goalID: "foo"
		// ... other goal props
	}],
	quests: [{
		name: "Go Beyond Diamond 1",
		questID: "bar",
		// ... other quest props
	}],
	goalSubs: [{
		userID: 1,
		goalID: "foo",
		achieved: true,
		// ... other goalsub props
	}],
	questSubs: [{
		userID: 3,
		questID: "bar",
		achieved: true,
		// ... other quest sub props
	}]
}
```

## Retrieve this game's recently interacted-with targets

`GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/recently-raised`

!!! info
	This endpoint returns the 100 most recently interacted-with goal subscriptions, and 50 most recently interacted-with quest subscriptions.

	A recently interacted with target subscription is one where `progress` or `outOf` has changed recently.

!!! warn
	This endpoint excludes achieved targets -- targets still get interacted with when achieved, which means a user with a lot of targets will just flood this endpoint with redundant updates on larger imports.

### Parameters

None.

### Response

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `goals` | Array&lt;GoalDocument&gt; | The goal documents that were recently achieved. |
| `quests` | Array&lt;QuestDocument&gt; | The quest documents that were recently achieved. |
| `goalSubs` | Array&lt;GoalSubDocument&gt; | User subscriptions to goals that were recently interacted with. |
| `questSubs` | Array&lt;QuestSubDocument&gt; | User subscriptions to quests that were recently interacted with. |

### Example

#### Request
```
GET /api/v1/games/iidx/SP/targets/recently-raised
```

#### Response

```js
{
	goals: [{
		name: "HARD CLEAR 5.1.1 Another",
		goalID: "foo"
		// ... other goal props
	}],
	quests: [{
		name: "Go Beyond Diamond 1",
		questID: "bar",
		// ... other quest props
	}],
	goalSubs: [{
		userID: 1,
		goalID: "foo",
		achieved: false,
		lastInteraction: 1649438990417,
		// ... other goalsub props
	}],
	questSubs: [{
		userID: 3,
		questID: "bar",
		achieved: false,
		lastInteraction: 1649438990415,
		// ... other quest sub props
	}]
}
```

#### Request
```
GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/goals/popular
```

#### Response

```js
[{
	name: "HARD CLEAR foo",
	// ...

## Retrieve information about a specific goal and its subscribers.

`GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/goals/:goalID`

### Parameters

None.

*****

## Evaluate a goal upon a user.

`GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/goals/:goalID/evaluate-for`

!!! note
	This endpoint is notably in a bit of a strange position. It can't go under UGPT because
	`UGPT/goals/:goalID` is for goal subscriptions, and overloading the endpoint to be
	something like "return the goal subscription or evaluate it if doesn't exist" is ugly.

	As such, it ends up here, but is generally a bit awkward.

### Parameters

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `userID` | String | The user to evaluate this goal for. |

### Response

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `goal` | GoalDocument | The goal document that was evaluated. |
| `user` | UserDocument | The user that this goal was evaluated for. |
| `results.achieved` | Boolean | Whether this user would have this goal achieved or not. |
| `results.progress` | Integer | What this user's progress would be on this goal. |
| `results.progressHuman` | String | A user friendly format for this user's goal progress. |
| `results.outOf` | Integer | What this goal was out of. |
| `results.outOfHuman` | String | A user friendly format for what this goal was out of. |

!!! info
	For more info on `progress`/`outOf`, see [Goals](../../codebase/implementation-details/goals-quests.md#evaluating-a-users-progress).

### Example

#### Request
```
GET /api/v1/games/iidx/SP/targets/goals/some_goal_id/evaluate-for?userID=zkrising
```

#### Response

```js
{
	user: {
		username: "zkrising",
		id: 1,
		// ...
	},
	goal: {
		goalID: "some_goal_id",
		name: "FULL COMBO some chart"
		// ...
	},
	result: {
		achieved: false,
		progress: 5,
		progressHuman: "EX HARD CLEAR",
		outOf: 6,
		outOfHuman: "FULL COMBO"
	}
}
```

*****

## Search quests for this GPT.

`GET /api/v1/games/:game/:playtype/targets/quests`

!!! note
	You might notice that there's no equivalent endpoint for goals.

	Searching goals for a GPT isn't very interesting, since they can be created by anyone at any time. The only reason goals are stored separately to subscriptions are for deduplication purposes and quests.

	As such, searching goals for a GPT is pointless, since technically it should search the set of all possible goals.

### Parameters

| :: | :: | :: |
| `search` | String | The query to search for. |

### Response

| Property | Type | Description |
| :: | :: | :: |
| `<body>` | Array&lt;QuestDocument&gt; | All of the quests that matched this search criteria. |

*****
